# BrickSmart-Text to LEGO Tutorial Generator (Backend)

This project provides a Django-based backend for generating 3D models from text, converting these models into LEGO brick instructions, and providing guided assembly steps.

## Features

- **Text-to-3D Model**: Generate 3D models using OpenAI's GPT models based on textual prompts.
- **3D Model to LEGO**: Convert 3D models into voxel representations and generate LEGO building instructions.
- **Guided Assembly**: Use AI to provide guided assembly steps, especially for children.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10
- Django 5.0.6
- Required Python libraries
- SQLite (for development)

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/JAdpp/BrickSmart-backend.git
    cd BrickSmart-backend\BackEnd
    ```

2. **Install Python libraries**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Set up the database:**

    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

5. **Run the development server:**

    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

    The server should now be running at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/model`.

### Configuration

- **API Keys**: Ensure you have the necessary API keys for OpenAI, Qiniu Cloud, and Tripo3D API.
    ```bash
    OPENAI_API_KEY=<your_openai_api_key>
    QINIU_ACCESS_KEY=<your_qiniu_access_key>
    QINIU_SECRET_KEY=<your_qiniu_secret_key>
    ```

### Usage

1. **Generate a 3D Model from Text:**

    - Navigate to the prompt page and enter a descriptive prompt.
    - The system will generate a 3D model based on the prompt.

2. **Convert a 3D Model to LEGO:**

    - Use the generated 3D model and follow the steps to convert it to LEGO building instructions.
    - The system provides a step-by-step guide for assembling the LEGO model.
